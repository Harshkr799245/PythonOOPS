        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ?\n",
        "  - OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects—which bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together. It promotes modularity, reusability, and scalability using key principles like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "  - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and behaviors the objects will have.\n",

        "3. What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with state and behavior.\n",

        " ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n",
        "  - Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features (via abstract classes or interfaces).\n",
        "  - Encapsulation binds data and methods inside a class and restricts access using access modifiers (like private).\n",

        "```\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP ?\n",
        "  - Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent or base class).\n",
        "  <br>  Ex:\n",
        "  \n",

        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
        "  - In OOP, polymorphism refers to an object's capacity to assume several forms.\n",
        "Simply said, polymorphism enables us to carry out a single activity in a variety of ways.\n",
        "  - From the Greek words poly (many) and morphism (forms), we get polymorphism. Polymorphism is the capacity to assume several shapes.\n",

        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to attributes and methods within a class. This is accomplished through naming conventions, specifically by using single or double underscores as prefixes.\n",
        "  - Public members:\n",
        "These are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class. They are declared without any underscores.\n",
        "  - Protected members:\n",
        "These are intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses. They are indicated by a single underscore prefix (e.g., `_attribute`). However, they can still be accessed from outside the class, but it's considered a convention not to do so.\n",
        "  - Private members:\n",
        "These are meant to be inaccessible from outside the class. They are denoted by a double underscore prefix (e.g., `__attribute`). Python implements name mangling for private members, making it difficult, but not impossible, to access them directly from outside the class.\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python ?\n",
        "  - A constructor in Python is a special method within a class that initializes the attributes of an object when the object is created. It is automatically called when an object of the class is instantiated. The constructor method is named `__init__`.\n",
        "  <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",

        "```\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python ?\n",
        "  - Class Methods:-Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They can access or\n",
        "  modify class state that applies across all instances of the class. Class methods are defined using the\n",
        "  @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "  -Static Methods:- Static methods are methods that belong to the class and don't access or modify class or instance state. They\n",
        "  are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ```\n",

        "100\n",
        "```\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP ?\n",
        "  - Method overriding : In Python, method overriding is the process of providing a different\n",
        "implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass within a subclass. It enables the\n",
        "subclass to define its own version of a method with the same name and parameters as the method in the\n",
        "superclass. When a method is overridden, the subclass implements the method in its own way, which\n",
        "overrides the behaviour defined in the superclass. The subclass can then alter or expand the functionality of\n",

        "13.  What is a property decorator in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, a property decorator is a built-in feature that allows methods to be accessed like attributes. It provides a way to encapsulate the logic for getting, setting, and deleting an attribute within a class, offering more control over attribute access and modification. The @property decorator is used to define the getter method, while the @attribute.setter and @attribute.deleter decorators are used to define the setter and deleter methods, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",

        "```\n",
        "14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, promoting code reuse and flexibility. This allows for dynamic method dispatch, where the method to be executed is determined at runtime, making the code more adaptable and extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python ?\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is designed to be subclassed by other classes. It serves as a blueprint, defining methods that subclasses must implement. Abstract classes are created using the abc (Abstract Base Classes) module and are useful for enforcing a common interface across a group of related classes.\n",

        "  \n",
        "  The key difference between a class variable (also known as a static variable) and an instance variable is their scope and how they are shared. Class variables are shared across all instances of a class, meaning they have only one copy regardless of how many objects are created from that class. Instance variables, on the other hand, are unique to each instance of the class, with each object having its own separate copy.\n",

        "  - The `__del__` method is a special method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows you to define specific cleanup actions that should be taken when an object is garbage collected. This method can be particularly useful for releasing external resources such as file handles, network connections, or database connections that the object may hold.\n",

        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",

        "  - Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" enables objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways. In Python, inheritance plays a crucial role in achieving polymorphism through a mechanism called method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "  class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Generic animal sound\"\n",

        "class Dog(Animal):\n",

        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining in Python is a programming technique used in object-oriented programming where multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line of code. This is achieved by having each method return the object instance (self) after performing its operation. This allows for a more concise and readable way to perform a series of actions on an object.\n",

        "    def __init__(self, value=0):\n",

        "  - The __call__ method in Python enables instances of a class to be called like regular functions. When a class defines this method, its instances become callable objects. The __call__ method is automatically executed when the instance is \"called\" using parentheses.\n",
